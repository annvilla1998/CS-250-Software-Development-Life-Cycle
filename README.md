1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way of interpreting user needs are by conducting user interview to develop user stories. User stories are descriptions of project features that explain what users want to be able to see and do. They help immensely in agile methodology when breaking down the a big project into smaller parts and into sprints.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to approach developing a program with a plan and firm approach. Without developing a plan, it is easy to get lost. As mentioned above, user stories are a big part of this planning so that not only I but the team can plan the project to be completed in a timely manner. Using agile tools such as Jira to keep track of these stories will be helpful for all of the team members to stay on track and on the same page. Jira is designed so we can keep track of tasks to be completed before the end of sprint and discuss the progress of each task at daily standups which help us discuss any drawbacks we are facing.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member on a software team means being receptive to change as requirements constantly do, being open to feedback, collaborating effectively, and having a proactive attitude. Giving constant positive feedback where its deserved is another great way to foster a positive environment for everyone on the team.
